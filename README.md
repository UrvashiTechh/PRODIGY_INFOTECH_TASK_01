📊 Task 1
Prodigy InfoTech – Data Science Internship

📌 Overview
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global population dataset, focusing on visualizing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable through bar charts and stacked plots.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is titled world_population_dataset.csv, containing population records from the year 2001 to 2022 for various countries.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Jupyter Notebook

Python Libraries:

pandas – data manipulation

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Data Cleaning
Checked for and handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Ensured proper data types for analysis

📊 Data Visualization
Created bar charts to represent population distributions by country

Generated a stacked bar chart to compare population over multiple years

Applied appropriate labels, color schemes, and titles for clarity

📈 Sample Visualizations
(Include PNG images or embed them if available)

Bar Chart: Population distribution across countries

Stacked Chart: Country-wise population trend (2001–2022)

🧠 Conclusion
This task provided key insights into the distribution and trends of population data globally. The visualizations not only made the data more interpretable but also laid a strong foundation for future modeling and forecasting tasks in the data science pipeline.
